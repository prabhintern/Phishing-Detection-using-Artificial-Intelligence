# Phishing-Detection-using-Artificial-Intelligence

Phishing attacks have become a significant threat to individuals and organizations, leading to financial losses, data breaches, and compromised security. This project aims to develop a robust phishing detection system utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The system will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify suspicious emails, URLs, and text messages, thus enhancing cybersecurity measures.

so here is a project developed purely to help individuals and organiations to protect them from data breaches!


METHODOLOGY:
1) Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of legitimate and phishing emails, URLs, and text messages. The dataset should cover a wide range of phishing techniques and attack vectors.

2) Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the collected data, including textual content, sender information, URL structure, and more. These features will serve as input to the machine learning models.

3) Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for phishing detection. Commonly used algorithms include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. Consider utilizing ensemble methods for improved accuracy.

4) Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the chosen machine learning models using the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5) Feature Engineering: Experiment with feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between legitimate and phishing content. This could involve NLP techniques for analyzing text or domain analysis for URLs.

6) Real-time Analysis: Develop a mechanism to analyze incoming emails and URLs in real-time. Implement a pipeline that processes and extracts features from incoming data.

7) Classification: Deploy the trained model to classify incoming content as either legitimate or phishing. Implement a confidence threshold to minimize false positives and negatives.

User Feedback Loop: Incorporate a feedback loop where user-reported phishing instances can be used to further train and improve the model over time.

8) Visualization and Reporting: Create a user-friendly interface that displays the results of the phishing detection process. Visualize statistics, detection rates, and any identified patterns.`
